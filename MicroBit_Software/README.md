0253_kl26z_microbit_0x8000.hex
Newest MicroBit Firmware (Version 0253)
To update firmware, connect the MicroBit via usb to your computer while holding
the RESET button on the back. It will connect as a volume labeled MAINTENANCE.
Copy the .hex file into the folder, and the MicroBit will automatically update the 
firmware. When finished, it will automatically dismount, and remount as MICROBIT
again. You can find the current firmware version in DETAILS.TXT in the MicroBit.

MicroPythonRuntime.hex
I recall reading somewhere that, using the online MicroPython editor for Microbit,
downloading the .hex file for a completely blank project will give you just the
MicroPython Runtime. From there, supposedly you can actually copy a .py python
file to the MICROBIT device that shows up on your computer in order to run the
file. But don't quote me on that, I have no idea what I'm actually doing here :)

EDIT: Uploading a completely blank python script as a .hex file does, in fact,
create a MicroPython runtime. This is useful to run REPL mode, but you can't drag
and drop .py scripts. Still neat though!

OutOfBoxExperience-v2hex
Pre-installed program when you take the MicroBit out of the box. Pretty self
explanatory now that I think about it...
